 #SHAPEAI PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP
 Hi I made this project during 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
 </b>.  
 The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to
 learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

 <br>I got to have hands on experince on:
 <li>Python
 <li>Machine Learning
 <li>Tensorflow
 <br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
 anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
 I enjoyed these 7 days, you can well,To register for next 7 days bootcamp, visit:
